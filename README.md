- 👋 Hi, I’m @Evenimous
- 👀 I’m interested in anything regarding computer gaming, computer hardware, operating systems, and computer programming, though I'd say I'm only decent with the first two as of the time of me writing this, Jan 10th 2022.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Network Administration, IT, PHP, CSS, Linux (specifically Ubuntu), and Windows.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems cool!
